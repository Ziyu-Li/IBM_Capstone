    "# Accident Severity in Seattle from 2004 to 2020\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "### Problem background and description\n",
    "Growth rate of population in Seattle ranks No.2 in US. As a fast growing city, the traffic congestion problems have become a terrible problem. Accourding to the 2019 Urban Mobility Report, Seattle rank 7th on the problem of time delay for auto commuters traveling during peak periods (6 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.). Increasing number of traffic accidents is one of the most contribution to traffic jams. If prediction of severity of traffic accidents can be made, traffic congestion problem can be relieved. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the development of machine learning, we want to use the data of traffic attributes including road condition, weather and other factors to predict accident severity  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Target Audience\n",
    "Our prediction of accident severity will be provided to the driver sufferred from traffic jams caused by traffic accidents and help them to decide whether they should change the routine or wait for the traffic jams. If the accident is serious and caused a large damage, we will recommend them to change their routine. Otherwise, they can still wait for traffic jams. Our prediction will help drivers to save their time and relieve traffic congestion.\n",

    "## Data\n",
    "### Data description\n",
    "The data of severity of accident I used is from ArcGIS Metadata form. It concludes 194673 collisions happened in Seattle from 2004 to 2020. 37 attributes have been records on each collision. There are two kinds of severity have been recorded in this data set, injury and prop damage.\n",

    "                                                                            \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data features\n",
    "There are several factors can be used to predict the sevrity of the collision: total number of vehicle involved in the collision, weather and road condition.\n",
    "Using these factors, we can cluster the collision based on these factors whetherit is injury or drop damage using k-Means methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relations between number of vehicle and the severity of accidents\n",
    "There are 172606 accidents have been recorded with known weather condition, road condition and number of vehicle. If the number of vehicle is high, we predict there will be a more serious accidents. We can see that, for all prop damage accidents, about 82% accidents with a vehicle number of 2. But for all injury accidents, 62% accidents with a vehicle number of 2. The fact indicates that severity is sensitive to the number of vehicle."
