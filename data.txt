The data of severity of accident I used is from ArcGIS Metadata form. It concludes 194673 collisions happened in Seattle from 2004 to 2020. 37 attributes have been records on each collision. There are two kinds of severity have been recorded in this data set, injury and prop damage. 
There are several factors can be used to predict the sevrity of the collision: the type of collision address, total number of people involved in the collision, the number of pedestrains involved in the collision, the number of injuried in the collusion, weather, road condition, light condition and speeding. 
Using these factors, we can cluster the collision based on these factors whetherit is injury or drop damage using k-Means methods.
